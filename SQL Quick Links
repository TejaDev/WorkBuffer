SQL query to list the blocking sessions and the sessions they are blocking:

SELECT
    blocker.SID AS blocker_sid,
    blocker.SERIAL# AS blocker_serial,
    blocker.USERNAME AS blocker_user,
    blocker.MACHINE AS blocker_machine,
    blocker.PROGRAM AS blocker_program,
    blocker.STATUS AS blocker_status,
    blocker.EVENT AS blocker_event,
    blocker.WAIT_TIME AS blocker_wait_time,
    blocked.SID AS blocked_sid,
    blocked.SERIAL# AS blocked_serial,
    blocked.USERNAME AS blocked_user,
    blocked.MACHINE AS blocked_machine,
    blocked.PROGRAM AS blocked_program,
    blocked.STATUS AS blocked_status,
    blocked.EVENT AS blocked_event,
    blocked.WAIT_TIME AS blocked_wait_time
FROM
    V$SESSION blocker
JOIN
    V$SESSION blocked
ON
    blocker.SID = blocked.BLOCKING_SESSION
WHERE
    blocker.BLOCKING_SESSION IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    blocker.SID, blocked.SID;


Query to list sessions with queries that have been running for a long time
SELECT
    s.SID,
    s.SERIAL#,
    s.USERNAME,
    s.MACHINE,
    s.PROGRAM,
    s.STATUS,
    s.SCHEMA#,
    s.SQL_ID,
    s.SQL_CHILD_NUMBER,
    s.SQL_ADDRESS,
    s.EVENT,
    s.WAIT_TIME,
    s.LAST_CALL_ET AS elapsed_time_seconds,
    q.SQL_TEXT
FROM
    V$SESSION s
JOIN
    V$SQL q
ON
    s.SQL_ID = q.SQL_ID
WHERE
    s.STATUS = 'ACTIVE'
    AND s.LAST_CALL_ET > 60  -- Adjust this threshold as needed (e.g., queries running longer than 60 seconds)
ORDER BY
    s.LAST_CALL_ET DESC;
